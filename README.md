# Social Media Example

In this project, I want to create a social media website with a limitation. That limitation is allowing users to only post once per day. It's a relatively weird limitation for a social media website, but it's the only one I could think of.

# Features I would like to implement

- Mobile responsive. I'm going to do this completely with plain css or maybe SASS to get more practice with the basics insead of using frameworks.
- Login/Authetication. This is something I haven't tried yet but I realize it's importance so I thought I would give it a shot.
- Create/Edit/Delete posts. This seems like a given for a project like this, but I would like to try and incorporate a backend for this site which is something I haven't tried yet.
- Database. I will try to incorporate a database for user post and explore what I could do with user data(algorithms, etc)
- Testing. I know very little about testing but it seems to be a very useful skill for most developers so I plan to learn more about it.
